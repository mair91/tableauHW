The presented analysis considered CITI BIKE data from 2019 and 2020 in order to identify changes in customer behavior, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemy.

The focus of the analysis were two: periods of the day of more trips and the gender trends.

It's clear that the first hours of the morning and the evening are the periods where most people start trips. Although, we can see some effects of the COVID-19 pandemy, mainly in the Summer mornings. This may be due to the number of workers currently in home office. Winter months were not as affected by the pandemy situation.

In gender, there has been a slight increase in the number of trips by women, we will have to wait to see if this phenomenon may be due to the Pandemy or the positive effects by the outreach to women. 

In general, there are important trends that have to be monitored to identify if they will remain or will revert back once normality is restored (hopefully).
